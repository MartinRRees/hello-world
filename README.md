# hello-world
this is my first repository where i am following the hello world github guide
so this is my second entry, my first commit as i understand it; i am intrigued by coding in general, specifically front-end development and design.  i am working and studying on a regular basis, a lot on some days and a few minutes on my busier days.  i couldn't be more excited to be on this journey!!
